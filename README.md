A collection of little games I have made.

#### Dungeon Gauntlet
This is a simple browser-based game I made as a means of learning how to code, back in 2013. As I figured out how to do more things, I piled more features onto the game. As a result, the game isn't very balanced. UI was not my main focus at the time, as the casual observer may notice. I had begun working on simple animations to make the combat encounters more interesting, but this never came to fruition (though some of the code is still in there).  
It's not exactly amazing, but it has come a *long* way since its first version. 

#### Tomb Rater
This is another menu-based game (like Dungeon Gauntlet). Inspired heavily by the game King of Dragon Pass (and also the browser based MMO Kingdom of Loathing), I made this around 2015. I'm now trying to [remake](https://github.com/rycoll/Tomb-Rater) it, with a less clunky UI.
Tomb Rater is a civilisation management game. The premise is that you are a king/queen of a fantasy-style kingdom, and you are trying to build the best possible tomb for yourself before you die. At the end of the game, your tomb is rated and you are given a score that represents how many years you were remembered for.

#### Loot
This is a little game I made while trying out 3D modelling/animation. It's not very finished.
The idea is that you warp into an area where there are lots of loot boxes scattered around, and you run around opening as many as possible before time runs out and you are warped back home.

#### Procedurhill
This is another 3D game, founded on the observation that it's fun to run up and down hills in video games. Procedurhill procedurally generates a big hill, and you run up/down it. There's a time limit, and you get a score at the end representing how far up/down the hill you went. The game tracks your highest and lowest (altitude-wise) scores.
